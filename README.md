# least-recently-used-cache-algorithm
This is a concurrent implementation of the Least Recently Used (LRU) cache algorithm written in Java
With this implementation order of items in the cache does not matter

With this implementation only one instance of a cache item access can exist at a time to avoid conflicts...
